// Set
// A set is a data structure that can hold a collections of values. The values however must be unique
// Set can contain a mix of different data types. You can store string, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set
// Sets are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it
// Sets do not maintain an insertion order
// Sets are iterable. They can be used with a for of loop

// Set vs Array
// Array can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot
// Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets
// Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays
